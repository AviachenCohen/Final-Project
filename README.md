# Exceptional Package Management System

## 📦 Project Overview
This repository contains the backend API for the Exceptional Package Management System, designed to manage parcels that require manual intervention due to delays or status mismatches — within a real-world logistics organization.

The solution improves oversight and response to anomalies in the delivery process by automating status monitoring, alert generation, and reporting. It was developed as part of an academic final project and reflects a complete product cycle: from problem analysis and requirements gathering, through system architecture, implementation, and deployment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Status Monitoring**: Background jobs continuously scan for outdated statuses (e.g., packages marked as "in transit" for too long).
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends alerts to logistics personnel when anomalies are detected.
- **Data Management**: All package data is stored in MongoDB using well-structured collections.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Custom reports are generated for various stakeholders.
- **Async Task Processing**: CSV file processing and other heavy-lift tasks are handled asynchronously with Celery and Redis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python / Flask** – RESTful API development
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL document database
- **Celery + Redis** – Background task queue
- **APScheduler** – Scheduled status scans
- **smtplib (SMTP)** – Email alert system
- **Wix / Velo** – Web-based frontend (not included here)
- **Heroku** – Cloud deployment

## 🧠 Architecture Diagram
![System Architecture](media/arch.png)

The system operates as a microservice for logistics oversight. It connects the organization's internal data sources with an external interface for logistics partners and distribution companies.

## 🗂️ MongoDB Collections

Each package record includes full traceability: status logs, update timestamps, distributor info, delay flags, and internal notes.

## 📊 Performance Snapshot
![Command Execution Rate](media/System-command-execution-rate-june-july.jpg)

A significant increase in operations per second (ops/s) is observed beginning July 6th, which aligns with the batch insertion of approximately 20,000 package records. This pattern confirms that the database handled the ingestion as expected, with stable operation throughput across all shards.

## 👥 Role-Based Views
- **Distributor Interface**: Handles bulk status updates.
- **Sample of the organization internal view**: Enables management and tracking of all parcels built-in statuses.

## Documentation & Presentation

The Exceptional Package Management System provides a practical, scalable foundation for improving operational efficiency in package logistics. Its architecture allows for flexible adaptation and integration with third-party vendors, and its data-centric approach makes it ideal for rapid decision-making.
